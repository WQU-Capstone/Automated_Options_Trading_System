# Automated_Options_Trading_System

Our project proposal highlights the effects of Market Regimes on the historical volatility and the trading performance of Options to which we present a technology stack and methodology aimed at developing an automated Options trading system and also present a Markov-switching Auto-regressive model as an effective model for predicting Regime shifts and lastly present a hedging strategy that minimizes the risk profile of an investment portfolio by utilizing our Market Regime predictive model to automatically re-balance the weights of assets in our investment portfolio to generate more consistent and favourable trading alphas.
